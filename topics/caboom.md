## Abstract

The Manhattan Project was a top-secret U.S.-led research initiative during World War II that developed the world’s first nuclear weapons. It began in 1939 in response to fears that Nazi Germany was working on an atomic bomb. The project brought together some of the greatest scientific minds of the era, including Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr, and Richard Feynman.

The multiple sites of the project included Los Alamos (New Mexico), Oak Ridge (Tennessee), and Hanford (Washington). Each site focused on different aspects of nuclear research—from uranium enrichment to plutonium production to weapon design. The scientists faced immense technical and theoretical challenges, but by July 1945 they had succeeded. The first nuclear explosion, known as the Trinity test, was detonated in the New Mexico desert, proving that an atomic bomb was feasible.

Less than a month later, two atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. The Manhattan Project not only ushered in the nuclear age but also marked a turning point in science, warfare, and geopolitics. It raised profound ethical questions about the use of such weapons and established the foundation for postwar nuclear arms races and the Cold War. The project's legacy continues to shape global security and energy policy today.
