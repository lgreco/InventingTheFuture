# Artificial Intelligence


## Abstract

The tragic brilliance of Walter Pitts, a self-taught prodigy, are also the foundations of cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and modern computational neuroscience. Fleeing an abusive home in 1930s Detroit, Pitts devoured Principia Mathematica at age 12, corrected errors in it, and corresponded with Bertrand Russell. At 15, he ran away to the University of Chicago, got a job as a janitor, and met Warren McCulloch—his intellectual match and lifelong collaborator.

Together, they modeled neurons as binary logic gates, proposing that thought arises from mechanistic neural computation—a framework that later inspired the architecture of modern computers and neural networks. Pitts impressed giants like Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann, and despite having no formal education, became a key figure at MIT.

Yet Pitts struggled with depression, alcoholism, and the limits of pure logic. Wiener abruptly cut ties after a false allegation, devastating Pitts. The later discovery that vision processing occurs partly in the eye—not just the brain—shook his logical worldview. He withdrew, destroyed his dissertation, and died in obscurity in 1969. 

This is the story of a man undone by the belief that logic alone could explain the world. -
