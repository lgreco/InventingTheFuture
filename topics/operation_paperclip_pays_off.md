# Operation Paperclip Pays Off

## Abstract

Operation Paperclip was a secret U.S. program launched in 1945 to recruit German scientists, engineers, and technicians—many of them former Nazis—after World War II. Its primary goal was to harness German scientific expertise for American military and technological advancement, particularly in rocketry, aerospace, and chemical weapons, and to prevent this knowledge from falling into Soviet hands. Over 1,600 individuals were brought to the U.S., often with their records sanitized to obscure Nazi affiliations.

Among the most influential recruits was Wernher von Braun, a key figure behind the V-2 rocket used by Nazi Germany. In the U.S., von Braun and his team became central to the development of American missile technology and later played a crucial role in the space race. Von Braun’s work at NASA led to the creation of the Saturn V rocket, which ultimately powered the Apollo missions and landed humans on the Moon in 1969.

Operation Paperclip had a profound and lasting impact on U.S. technological supremacy, especially in the Cold War context. However, it also sparked moral controversy. Many of the scientists had been involved with or complicit in the Nazi regime, including use of forced labor.
