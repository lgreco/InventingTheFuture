# Operation Paperclip Pays Off

## Abstract

Operation Paperclip was a secret U.S. program launched in 1945 to recruit German scientists, engineers, and technicians—many of them former Nazis—after World War II. Its primary goal was to harness German scientific expertise for American military and technological advancement, particularly in rocketry, aerospace, and chemical weapons, and to prevent this knowledge from falling into Soviet hands. Over 1,600 individuals were brought to the U.S., often with their records sanitized to obscure Nazi affiliations.

Among the most influential recruits was Wernher von Braun, a key figure behind the V-2 rocket used by Nazi Germany. In the U.S., von Braun and his team became central to the development of American missile technology and later played a crucial role in the space race. Von Braun’s work at NASA led to the creation of the Saturn V rocket, which ultimately powered the Apollo missions and landed humans on the Moon in 1969.

Operation Paperclip had a profound and lasting impact on U.S. technological supremacy, especially in the Cold War context. However, it also sparked moral controversy. Many of the scientists had been involved with or complicit in the Nazi regime, including use of forced labor.

## Summary


# Handout: Operation Paperclip – The Strategic and Ethical Mobilization of German Intellectual Capital

### **I. Introduction and Definition**
**Operation Paperclip** was a secret United States intelligence program in which **more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians** were taken from former Nazi Germany to the U.S. for government employment following the end of World War II in Europe. Conducted primarily between **1945 and 1959**, the program aimed to leverage German expertise for the ongoing war against Japan and to bolster postwar military research. The operation was managed by the **Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA)**, a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), and actioned by special agents of the **U.S. Army's Counterintelligence Corps (CIC)** and the **Office of Strategic Services (OSS)**. The project’s operational name derived from the **ordinary paperclips** used to attach new, falsified political personae and employment biographies to the folders of scientists whom recruiters wished to employ, essentially "bleaching" their records of Nazi affiliations to grant them security clearances. At least half of the specialists brought to the U.S. had been members of the Nazi Party, with some being leaders of the party or members of the SS or SA.

### **II. Historical Context and Origins**
The program’s origins lie in the final months of World War II as Allied forces discovered that German **"wonder weapons" (Wunderwaffen)**, such as the V-1 cruise missile and the **V-2 ballistic rocket**, were years or even decades ahead of contemporary Allied technology. In 1943, the U.S. formed a top-secret mission codenamed the **Alsos Mission** to search for information regarding the Nazis’ biological, chemical, and nuclear programs. A significant breakthrough occurred in March 1945 when a lab technician at Bonn University found fragments of the **Osenberg List**—a catalog of 15,000 politically vetted German scientists—which became a primary blueprint for American recruitment. 

The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) officially established the first recruitment program, **Operation Overcast**, on July 20, 1945. Its official objective was to bring experts to the United States for six months to a year to assist in the Pacific war, but after Japan's sudden surrender in August 1945, the program evolved into a permanent immigration initiative. Overcast was renamed **Operation Paperclip in November 1945** after its codename was compromised by the letters of scientists' families.

### **III. Strategic Motivations: Denial and Reparations**
The United States government viewed these scientists as **"intellectual reparations"**—human sources of technical knowledge that the Allies felt entitled to seize as compensation for the devastation of the war. The program was valued at approximately **US$10 billion in patents and industrial processes**. Beyond rocketry, the U.S. sought expertise in synthetic rubber, oil catalysts, jet engines, and aero medicine research.

A secondary, yet vital goal was the **policy of strategic denial**. American officials feared that if these "chosen, rare minds" were not secured, they would fall under the control of the **Soviet Union** or emigrate to neutral nations like Argentina or Spain. The JIC warned that Soviet recruitment of these specialists could allow the USSR to achieve technological parity in **atomic research and guided missiles**. This fear intensified as the Cold War began to emerge, making the immigration of ex-Nazis more palatable to government officials who believed that denying their knowledge to the Soviets was a **national security imperative**.

### **IV. Administrative Circumvention and "Whitewashing"**
Project Paperclip operated in direct violation of **President Harry Truman's** public directive, which expressly excluded any individual found to be a **member of the Nazi Party** or an active supporter of militarism. However, because many of the most valuable scientists were high-ranking Nazis or SS officers, JIOA and OSS officials bypassed this by **eliminating or whitewashing incriminating evidence** of war crimes from the scientists’ dossiers. 

When the State Department review panel initially rejected dossiers due to "ardent Nazi" classifications, the JIOA director requested that the **Army CIC revise the security reports** to expunge offending language. This conflict between the **State Department’s legal obligations** to immigration law and the **military's national security goals** lasted until late 1947. The compromise effectively shifted the legal responsibility for security certifications to the military and Justice Department, allowing the State Department to avoid responsibility for certifying that former Nazis posed no threat to the United States.

### **V. Key Figures and Technological Contributions**
The recruits of Operation Paperclip were instrumental in reshaping American military and scientific infrastructure. 

1.  **Wernher von Braun:** The most notable recruit, von Braun was the technical director of the **Peenemünde Army Research Center** and a member of the SS. Though involved in the exploitation of slave labor at the **Mittelwerk factory**, he was brought to the U.S. in 1945 to lead the ballistic weapon program. He later became the director of NASA’s **Marshall Space Flight Center** and was the chief architect of the **Saturn V rocket**, which enabled the 1969 Moon landing.
2.  **Arthur Rudolph:** The operations director for V-2 production at Mittelwerk, where approximately **20,000 slave laborers died**. He managed the development of the Pershing missile and the Saturn V rocket. In 1984, following an investigation into his role in Nazi atrocities, he renounced his U.S. citizenship and returned to Germany to avoid prosecution.
3.  **Hubertus Strughold:** Known as the **"Father of Space Medicine,"** Strughold was the chief of aeromedical research for the Luftwaffe. His valuable research in the U.S. was derived from **unethical human experiments** conducted at Dachau, including high-altitude and hypothermia tests on prisoners. Despite this, he served in high-level scientific posts for the Air Force and NASA until his death in 1986.
4.  **Walter Schreiber:** The former Surgeon General of the Third Reich, Schreiber was instrumental in **medical experiments on concentration camp inmates** at Ravensbrück. He was recruited by the U.S. Air Force in 1951, but after a 1952 newspaper exposé and testimony from survivor **Janina Iwanska**, he was discretely relocated by the U.S. military to Argentina.
5.  **Reinhard Gehlen:** Hitler’s senior intelligence officer on the Eastern Front, he was hired to operate a network of **600 ex-Nazi agents** in the Soviet zone. The "Gehlen Org" became the CIA's primary eyes and ears in Eastern Europe and eventually formed the basis of the West German intelligence service, the **BND**.

### **VI. Ethical Controversies and Human Rights Violations**
The core conundrum of Operation Paperclip is whether scientific accomplishment can **cancel out past crimes**. While the U.S. was leading the **Nuremberg Trials** and drafting the **Nuremberg Code** to protect human subjects, it was simultaneously shielding perpetrators of heinous atrocities. 

*   **Slave Labor:** Much of the rocket research and production was conducted through **forced labor at Mittelbau-Dora**, where thousands were worked to death in underground tunnels.
*   **Human Experimentation:** Recruits were linked to experiments involving high-altitude exposure, **hypothermia (freezing water tests)**, and the intentional infection of prisoners with gangrene and typhus.
*   **U.S. Government Complicity:** In several cases, the U.S. government became **complicit in Nazi war crimes** by shielding doctors from prosecution, covering up past criminal connections, and utilizing knowledge acquired through **heinous atrocities**.

### **VII. Public Reaction and the Cold War Shift**
Initial public reaction to the discovery of Nazi scientists on U.S. soil was **overwhelmingly negative**. Prominent figures like **Albert Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt** registered sharp protests, calling the recruits "potentially dangerous" and "bacillus carriers of Nazism". However, as the **Red Scare** and Cold War tensions escalated, government propaganda began to "whitewash" the recruits' images, depicting them as "good Germans" who were essential to national defense. 

There was a notable correlation between terminology and perception: when the specialists were referred to as **"Nazis,"** reactions were negative; when referred to as **"German scientists"** who were saving the U.S. billions of dollars, public acceptance increased. By the mid-1950s, the **threat of Communism** had largely overshadowed concerns about the recruits' Nazi pasts.

### **VIII. Comparative Assessment: The Global Race for Talent**
The United States was not the only power conducting such operations. 

*   **Soviet Union (Operation Osoaviakhim):** A much larger operation where, on the night of October 22, 1946, the NKVD **drafted over 2,500 specialists at gunpoint** and transported them to the USSR via 92 freight trains. However, because the Soviets **isolated and "mothballed"** their recruits rather than integrating them, their program is often considered less successful than the U.S. approach.
*   **United Kingdom (Operation Surgeon):** A smaller program that recruited roughly **100 Nazi scientists** for British R&D facilities.
*   **France:** Offered very generous inducements, including **citizenship and royalties**, which the U.S. saw as significant competition.

### **IX. Investigations and the End of Secrecy**
The "sanitized" history of these scientists began to erode in the 1970s and 1980s. 

1.  **Office of Special Investigations (OSI):** Created in 1979 within the Department of Justice, the OSI was tasked with identifying and deporting individuals who participated in Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution.
2.  **Holtzman Amendment (1978):** Closed the "Paperclip loophole" by creating a statutory basis to **deport Nazi war criminals**.
3.  **Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act (1998):** Launched the largest congressionally mandated declassification effort in history, resulting in the release of **over 8.5 million pages of records**. This effort aimed to repair the damage of government indifference and provide a full accounting of U.S. dealings with war criminals.

### **X. Conclusion: The "Ends Justifying Means" Legacy**
Operation Paperclip was a **"great moral compromise"**. Proponents argue that without these scientists, the U.S. might have **lost the Cold War or the Space Race**, noting that the balance of power could have easily shifted to the Soviet Union. Opponents point to the **extraordinary ethical cost** of ignoring war crimes and integrating a genocidal ideology into the heart of a democratic superpower. The program remains a cautionary tale about the **contradictions of the national security state**, where material advancement was secured at the expense of moral clarity and international law. Fulfilling the legacy of those who sought justice at Nuremberg remains a **collective responsibility** to ensure that the "poisoned chalice" of impunity is never passed again.
