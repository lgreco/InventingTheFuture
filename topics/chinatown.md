# Chinatown


## Abstract

The Hoover Dam, completed in 1936 during the Great Depression, is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in U.S. history. Built on the Colorado River at the border of Nevada and Arizona, the dam was designed to provide hydroelectric power, flood control, and, crucially, a stable water supply for the arid Southwest. It enabled the growth of major cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas by regulating water distribution across seven western states through the Colorado River Compact.

California, with its booming population and agriculture, quickly became a central player in the West’s so-called “water wars.” Los Angeles in particular pursued aggressive strategies to secure water from distant sources, including the Owens Valley. In the early 20th century, city officials—led by William Mulholland—diverted Owens River water to Los Angeles via the Los Angeles Aqueduct, effectively drying out local farms and sparking intense conflict.

This complex and often underhanded history of water rights inspired the 1974 film Chinatown, directed by Roman Polanski and starring Jack Nicholson. The film fictionalizes the events of early Los Angeles water politics through a noir detective story, revealing corruption, exploitation, and the manipulation of public resources for private gain. While dramatized, Chinatown captures the real tensions between urban expansion, environmental stewardship, and political power.

Together, the Hoover Dam, California’s water struggles, and Chinatown illustrate how water—scarce and essential—has shaped the American West through engineering feats, political battles, and cultural reflection on the cost of progress.
