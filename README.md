# Hidden Geniuses and Forgotten Stories<br/>in the Global Technopolis

## Abstract

This course is a journey across the last 250 years of human ingenuity, told through the lens of 10–15 scientific and technological breakthroughs that reshaped the world. From the invention of chronometers to the sequencing of the human genome, we'll explore not just how things work—but why they were invented, who made them, and what kind of world they left behind.

No STEM background is required—just curiosity. We'll break down the core science behind each breakthrough in plain language, and then zoom out to examine the social, economic, and cultural forces at play. Who was asking the big questions? Who was solving them? And what happened next?

Topics include neural networks (inspired by a bourbon-fueled janitor at UChicago), the engineering of the Hoover Dam, the overlooked inventor of the Pap smear, the bicycle mechanics who cracked flight, and the birth of cities, computing, nuclear power, and more. Expect hands-on experiences too—we’ll listen to ham radio signals, trace the path of the Great Chicago Fire, and possibly visit The Henry Ford Museum to see invention in motion.

This is history told through invention. And invention told through people.

## Learning Assessement and Grading Policy

Class attendance, participation, and engagement make up 50% of the course grade. The rest of the grade is based on a term paper you are expected to write. 
* Attendance: you come to class on time; you do not miss more than 2 class meetings.
* Participation: you participate in the discussion during the meeting, sharing your understanding of the subject matter.
* Engagement: you come to class prepared, having read the material for the subject matter.

* Grade scale
  * **A:** you missed no class meetings and you participated in each meeting and you came prepared for every class meeting and our term paper meets format, style, and content specifications and it's well written.
  * **B:** you missed one or two class meetings or you did not participate in 1-2 meetings or you did not come prepared for in 1-2 meetings or your term paper does not fully meet the specifications.
  * **C:** you missed 3-4 class meetings or you did not participate in 3-4 meetings or you did not come prepared in 3-4 meetings or your term paper is poorly written.
