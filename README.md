# Hidden Geniuses and Forgotten Stories in the Global Technopolis

## Abstract

This course is a journey through the last 250 years of human ingenuity, told through the lens of 10–15 scientific and technological breakthroughs that reshaped the world. From the invention of chronometers to the rise of artificial intelligence, we'll explore not just how things work—but why they were invented, who made them, and what kind of world they left behind.

No STEM background is required—just curiosity. We'll break down the core science behind each breakthrough in plain language, and then zoom out to examine the social, economic, and cultural forces at play. Who was asking the big questions? Who was solving them? And what happened next?

Topics include neural networks (inspired by a bourbon-fueled janitor at UChicago), the engineering of the Hoover Dam, the overlooked inventor of the Pap smear, the bicycle mechanics who cracked flight, and the birth of cities, computing, nuclear power, and more. Expect hands-on experiences too—we’ll listen to ham radio signals, trace the path of the Great Chicago Fire, and possibly visit The Henry Ford Museum to see invention in motion.

This is history told through invention. And invention told through people.

## Outline
(alphabetical)

### Artificial Intelligence 
(How a homeless janitor at the University of Chicago fueled by ice cream and bourbon invented neural networks)

### Biking in Three Dimensions 
(Why it took two bicycle makers to invent flight)

### Carpenter Timekeeper 
(Harrison chronometer; imperial navies; the longitude problem)

### Chinatown 
(Hoover Dam; water wars; the Great Depression)

### Caboom 
(Dawn of Nuclear Age: from Marie Curie to Enrico Fermi)

### Farmer's Table 
(Ford's work on internal combustion)

### Inventing a City 
(reconstruction of Chicago; Pullman; Burnham etc; Doxiadis Megapolis. This can be enhanced by a tour exploring the Chicago Fire path etc)

### Migrant's Wife 
(Mache Papanicolaou's role in the development of life saving cancer screening - the Pap smear)

### Superhet 
(the invention of radio and the transformation of telecommunications -- will include ham radio demo)

### The Other German Printer 
(Otto Mergenthaler and the other revolution of mass printing -- field trip to Manitowoc WI print museum?)
