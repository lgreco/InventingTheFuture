# Hidden Geniuses and Forgotten Stories in the Global Technopolis

# Abstract

This course is a journey through the last 250 years of human ingenuity, told through the lens of 10–15 scientific and technological breakthroughs that reshaped the world. From the invention of chronometers to the rise of artificial intelligence, we'll explore not just how things work—but why they were invented, who made them, and what kind of world they left behind.

No STEM background is required—just curiosity. We'll break down the core science behind each breakthrough in plain language, and then zoom out to examine the social, economic, and cultural forces at play. Who was asking the big questions? Who was solving them? And what happened next?

Topics include neural networks (inspired by a bourbon-fueled janitor at UChicago), the engineering of the Hoover Dam, the overlooked inventor of the Pap smear, the bicycle mechanics who cracked flight, and the birth of cities, computing, nuclear power, and more. Expect hands-on experiences too—we’ll listen to ham radio signals, trace the path of the Great Chicago Fire, and possibly visit The Henry Ford Museum to see invention in motion.

This is history told through invention. And invention told through people.
